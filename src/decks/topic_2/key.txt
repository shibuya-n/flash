one : central processing unit : hardware component that can perform basic arithmetic and logical operations; contains the control unit, arithmetic logic unit, memory address register, memory data register
two : arithmetic logic unit : performs all the basic arithmetic or logical operations
three : control unit : controls retrieval of instructions from the 'primary memory' and their sequence of execution; also performs the decoding
four : register : a component that stores data/instructions for processing
five : memory address register (MAR) : holds the address of the data to be used by the ALU; located in the control unit
six : memory data register (MDR) : holds the data that is to be used by the ALU and then saved to the 'RAM'; located in the control unit
seven : primary memory : memory that the CPU accesses directly; is volatile (loses its contents when it is shut off)
eight : random access memory (RAM) : stores current executing
nine : cache memory : a small, high-speed memory located close to the CPU that stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing
ten : read-only memory (ROM) : non-volatile (data isn't lost when shut off) memory used to store firmware or software that is rarely changed
eleven : secondary memory : non-volatile storage that holds data and programs not actively in use, such as hard drives or SSDs
twelve : hard disk : a magnetic storage device used for storing large amounts of data in secondary memory
thirteen : solid-state drive (SSD) : a faster, non-volatile storage device that uses flash memory instead of spinning disks
fourteen : optical storage : the use of laser technology to read and write on discs such as CDs, DVDs, or Blu-rays
fifteen : fetch-decode-execute-store cycle : the process by which a computer retrieves an instruction, decodes it, and then executes it
sixteen : clock speed : measures the rate at which a CPU executes instructions, typically in gigahertz (GHz)
seventeen : bus : a communication system that transfers data between components inside or between computers
eighteen : data bus : carries data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices (think peripherals)
nineteen : address bus : transmits the physical location of data to be accessed or written by the CPU
twenty : control bus : it manages the communication between the computer's CPU and its other components, specializes in transferring control signals that coordinate and regulate the hardware's actions
twenty one : input/output (I/O) devices : any operation, program, or device that transfers data to or from a computer. some examples include printers, hard disks, keyboards, and mice
twenty two : peripheral devices : an auxiliary hardware device that a computer uses to transfer information externally. some examples include keyboards, mice, and monitors
twenty three : operating system (OS) : a set of software that controls the computer's hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. it acts as a link between software and hardware (ex. macOS, windows)
twenty four : kernel : a computer program at the core of a computer's OS and generally has complete control over everything in the system
twenty five : patches : data that is intended to be used to modify an existing software resources such as a program or file, often used to fix bugs or security risks
